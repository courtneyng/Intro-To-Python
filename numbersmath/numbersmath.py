# This shows the beginning, asking about the chickens and using the basic print command
print ("I will now count my chickens.")
# This shows the amount of chickens you have printing which kind of chicken and the amount
print ('hens', 25 + 30 / 6)
print ('roosters', 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)
# This prints the next topic which is counting eggs
print ('Now I will count the eggs.')
# This counts how many eggs there are
print (3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)
# This asks a math question
print ('Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?')
# This answers the question above
print (3 + 2 < 5 - 7)
# This divides up and answers the parts of the question previously

# This prints a statement
print ("Oh, that's why it's false.")
# This proposes more info
print ('How about some more.')
# These ask and answer based on the information above.
